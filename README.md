Objective:
This project contains three C++ programs, each demonstrating the use of conditional statements (if, else if, else) to solve common beginner-level problems:
1. Grade Calculator – Calculates average marks and assigns a grade.
2. Coordinate Locator – Identifies the position of a point in a 2D plane.
3. Number Sign Checker – Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Program 1: Grade Calculator

Logic:
Inputs scores for Maths, Chemistry, Physics, English, Biology.
Calculates the average.
Assigns grade based on the following scale:
O: 90 and above
A: 80 – 89
B: 70 – 79
C: 60 – 69
D: 50 – 59
FAIL: Below 50

Program 2: Coordinate Locator

Logic:
If x > 0 && y > 0 → 1st Quadrant
If x < 0 && y > 0 → 2nd Quadrant
If x < 0 && y < 0 → 3rd Quadrant
If x > 0 && y < 0 → 4th Quadrant
If x = 0 && y ≠ 0 → On Y-axis
If x ≠ 0 && y = 0 → On X-axis
If x = 0 && y = 0 → Origin

Program 3: Positive, Negative or Zero Checker

Logic:
If number > 0 → Positive
If number < 0 → Negative
If number = 0 → Equal to Zero

This combined project strengthens the understanding of decision-making in C++. These problems are essential practice for anyone starting with programming fundamentals, especially focusing on:
1. User input handling
2. Decision logic
3. Output formatting
